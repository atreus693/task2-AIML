Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries including Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly. The analysis includes generating summary statistics, creating histograms and boxplots for numerical features, visualizing relationships using pairplots and correlation heatmaps, and identifying patterns in survival rates across gender, passenger class, and fare. Interactive and static visualizations help uncover insights such as survival trends and feature distributions. This EDA serves as a foundation for deeper data understanding and future machine learning tasks.
